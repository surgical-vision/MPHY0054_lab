"""

To complete this assignment, you must do the following:
    - Fill the "youbot_dh_parameters" dictionary with the youbot DH parameters you found in question 5a
    - Complete the definition of standard_dh().
    - Complete the definition of forward_kinematics().
    - Complete the definition of fkine_wrapper(). To do this you should use your implementation of standard_dh() and forward_kinematics(). 
    - Initialise the subscriber to the topic that publishes joint states and its callback function fkine_wrapper()

In case you need to implement additional functions, define them in this file.

Complete the function implementation within the indicated area and do not modify the
assertions. The assertions are there to make sure that your code will accept and return
data with specific types and formats.

You can use code you developed during previous lab sessions, just make sure you adapt to follow this template.

** Important, you can use the cw1q5b.launch file to visualize the frames. The frames reported from 
your code are not supposed to match the preloaded youbot. This is why we have hidden it intentionally. 
Try to move the sliders in the joint_state_publisher gui and observe your robot's behaviour. If you code 
is correct, when you specify zero angles for all the joints using the robot state publisher, you should 
see all the frames stacked in the z axis (the home position).
