To complete this assignment, you must do the following:
    - Fill the "youbot_dh_parameters" dictionary with the youbot DH parameters you 
        found in question 5c
    - Fill the "youbot_joint_offsets" dictionary to account for the joint offsets
        between the "youbot_dh_parameters" you found and the xarco representation.
    - Complete the definition of fkine_wrapper(). In this example you can use the
        functions you implemented for 5b, we already imported forward_kinematics() which
        you most definitely need. If you haven't implemented forward_kinematics()
        during 5b, your node will not work.
    - Initialise the subscriber to the topic that publishes joint states and its callback
    function fkine_wrapper()


You may need to implement additional functions, for instance to convert rotation
matrices to quaternions. If that's the case, define and implement all those functions
inside this file.

In case you need to implement additional functions, define them in this file.

Complete the function implementation within the indicated area and do not modify the
assertions. The assertions are there to make sure that your code will accept and return
data with specific types and formats.

You can use code you developed during previous lab sessions, just make sure you adapt to follow this template.

Remember, in /joint_states messages are describing joint encoder readings.
Depending on how the encoders are mounted and also how your dh parameters have been defined
You may need to modify the joint_states by either applying an offset, changing the
sign of the reported angle or both. We already asked you to define an offset dictionary
which you can apply directly to dh parameters, but you also need to change the polarity
of the angle reading in order for the robot to work properly.

Running the launch file associated with this question, you should see that your frames
fall on the exact joint positions of the Youbot.
